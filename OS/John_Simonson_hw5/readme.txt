Degree of Sucess: ~70-75%

I completed both best fit and first fit as they were described in the assignment.
The output of my code matches the .txt files on ~bill/cs308/ however I was not able
to implement buddy system by the due date. Since I completed 2/3 of the required 
allocation policies I would rate my success at about 70-75%.
