I completed the assignment as described and have not detected any errors.
I would rate my degree of success as 100%

The queue size of 50% deadlock is between 40-50 queue slots. The number of
deadlocks stays at 0% at about 70 slots or more.
(graph contained in a3_queue.pdf)

step 8:
using 45 queue slots 1 ran 10 loops of the program using 1-10 consumers
the program started with 0 deadlocks and the number of deadlocks increased
with each consumer added until it deadlocks about 60% of the time
(results in a3_consumer.pdf)
