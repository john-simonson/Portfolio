I completed the assignment as described and have no noticeable errors.
Most of the code for this assignment was given to us in the help file
or shown during lecture. The queue size I found for 50% deadlock was
1850. The percent of deadlock with a queue of 2300 was 40% however I
believe this to be an outline based on the other data points. The 
percent of deadlock went up as the number of dozens rose. At 1000
the deadlock percent was 20% and topped out at 70% at 3000 dozens.

Data for the queue size and dozens is contained within the pdf files
attached.

output.txt contains the results for a queue size of 1850 and 2000
dozens.
